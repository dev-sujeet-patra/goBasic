# goBasic
- If your own code or package is provided by 3rd parties you must create a work space.
- A worspace is a directory hiearrchy that contains GO source code and the package objects and command binaries that compiler producces from the source code.
- You can create a workspace anywhere in your system. 
- Let's create a workspace now in a directory named "gocode".
- Tell the go tool about that workspace set the *GOPATH* environment variable.
  - `export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode`
- Source code resides in **src** directory of our workspace.
- Let's make a directory **src** and inside it.
- We will create a namespace, a unique base path inside which all of your ***go code***  will reside.
- I use the base path of my gitthub account github.com/example 
  - **`cd gocode`**
  - **`mkdir -p src/github.com/example`** 
- We are now ready to write programm.
- We will start with hello world command . So let's create a directory **hello** inside the namespace.
  - **`cd src/github.com/example`**
  - **`mkdir hello`**
  - **`cd hello`**
- Create a file named **hello.go**
- We would add simple and standard hello world program inside hello.go .
- Adding to main package is the convention that tells the go tool to **produce an executable command instead of a package object , that would be imported by other code.**
- Exiting the editor(vi) we can use go tool to build and install that binary.
  - **`go install`**
- If the go tool produces no output that means that command was a success.
- The go tool (go install) installed it to the **`bin`** directory of workspace `gocode`.
- Since we are going to install and run  a bunch of go program in the forseeable future.
- It makes sense to add the bin directory to our system path.
  - **` export PATH=$HOME/gocode/bin:$PATH `**
- Lets create an ***package*** , are just like commands except they can be imported by other ***packages*** and have a *package name other than **'main'***.
- We will start with simple string handling package.
- Let's create a directory inside the namespace called string and in that directory we will create a file string.go.
- String utility would have a simple function that reverses a string.
- We start writing the function name begins as capital R, function is exportred .
- import the string package in hello program.
- Is there bug in our code somewhere? It could be but we have not write any test.
- Let's write test for this for the 'String' utility package for Reverse function to make sure this is correct.
- Test for a package live in that package directory in files that end in underscore test.
- Go to string package.
- Import **`testing`** package.
- Find the attached program for better understanding of things to take care.
- Run the test with command **`go test`** inside same testing package.
