# goBasic
- If your own code or package is provided by 3rd parties you must create a work space.
- A worspace is a directory hiearrchy that contains GO source code and the package objects and command binaries that compiler producces from the source code.
- You can create a workspace anywhere in your system. 
- Let's create a workspace now in a directory named "gocode".
- Tell the go tool about that workspace set the *GOPATH* environment variable.
  - `export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode`
- Source code resides in **src** directory of our workspace.
- Let's make a directory **src** and inside it.
- We will create a namespace, a unique base path inside which all of your ***go code***  will reside.
- I use the base path of my gitthub account github.com/example 
  - **`cd gocode`**
  - **`mkdir -p src/github.com/example`** 
- We are now ready to write programm.
- We will start with hello world command . So let's create a directory **hello** inside the namespace.
  - **`cd src/github.com/example`**
  - **`mkdir hello`**
  - **`cd hello`**
- Create a file named **hello.go**
- We would add simple and standard hello world program inside hello.go .
- Adding to main package is the convention that tells the go tool to **produce an executable command instead of a package object , that would be imported by other code.**
